If you had a 2017 Marketplace insurance plan, you should have received two 2018 re-enrollment letters: one from your insurance company and one from the Health Insurance Marketplace.

## Your Health Insurance Marketplace letter includes: 

* Any actions you must take to get a premium tax credit for 2018. This may mean you have to send documents, like tax or income information.
* How to update your application for 2018 to make sure you get the right premium tax credit for the year

## Your insurance company letter includes: 

* Whether your 2017 plan is available in 2018.
* If not, whether the company is offering you a similar or alternate plan.
* Any changes to the plan for 2018.
* The 2018 premium, after any premium tax credit has been applied. The tax credit may be based on your 2017 information or on information the Marketplace has from other sources.

Be sure to keep your Health Insurance Marketplace and insurance company letters in a safe place and have them handy when you enroll in 2018 health coverage.
